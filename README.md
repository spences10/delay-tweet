# deleay tweet

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/spences10/delay-tweet.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is going to be a bot that uses the `stream.on` method and popps what comes out of the that into an array object:

```javascript
obj {
  tweet: someTweet,
  timestamp: timestamp,
  delay: timestamp + delay
}
```
